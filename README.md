# LINEAR-REGRESSION
Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables ( ùë• x) and the output variable ( ùë¶ y). The goal is to find the line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that best fits the data, minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values.
The general equation for linear regression is:  y=mx+c(for simple linear rgression )

Steps in Linear Regression
Data Preprocessing:
Ensure data is clean (no missing or irrelevant values).
Scale features if necessary.
Model Training:
Fit a regression model to the training data to learn the coefficients.
Evaluation:
Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), to evaluate the model's performance.
Prediction:
Use the model to predict the target variable for new data.
